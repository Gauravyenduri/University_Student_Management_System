/*
  This file is referenced by the HTML templates.
  However, styling is primarily handled by Tailwind CSS utility classes
  applied directly in the HTML markup, loaded via the CDN script in the <head>.
  You can add minimal base styles or custom component styles here if needed,
  but aim to use Tailwind utilities as much as possible.
*/

/* Example of a potential base style (optional): */
/* body {
    @apply font-sans bg-gray-100 text-gray-800;
} */
/* Note: Using @apply requires a build step, so stick to utility classes in HTML when using CDN */

body {
    /* Add fallback font if Tailwind doesn't load? */
    font-family: sans-serif;
   }
